To compile this code run `ant` in this directory.

To run any algorithm for part  1, run `java -cp ABAGAIL.jar tests.OptdigitsTest` and follow the instructions of the output.

The outputed CSV will contain training and testing errors over iterations.

To run the algorithms for part 2, run

java -cp ABAGAIL.jar opt.test.MyTravelingSalesman
java -cp ABAGAIL.jar opt.test.NQueensTest
java -cp ABAGAIL.jar opt.test.MyKnapsackTest

Any of these three, and  the outputted CSV will have the metrics  for those tests. To change values, change by hand in file.
